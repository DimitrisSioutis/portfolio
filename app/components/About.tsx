   From a young age, my passion for design and technology led me to full-stack web development. I love crafting visually engaging and efficient digital experiences, blending form and function to build seamless applications. With a Computer Science degree from Harokopeio University of Athens, I explored various programming languages but found my calling in web development. My thesis focused on leveraging modern web technologies for a robust content management system.

    I have worked with the Poukamisas Educational Group, where I developed innovative digital learning objects, enhancing educational experiences.  I am currently working on the plaisio.gr and pro.plaisio platforms, utilizing cutting-edge tools and technologies such as Next.js and .NET to deliver dynamic, scalable, and visually appealing solutions for one of Greece	&apos;s leading e-commerce platforms.
