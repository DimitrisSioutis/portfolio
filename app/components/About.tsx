    From a young age, I&apos;ve been drawn to the world of design. What started as a love for drawing and creative expression soon merged with a fascination for technology, leading me to the dynamic field of full-stack web development. Now, I&apos;m passionate about crafting visually engaging and efficient digital experiences, bringing together form and function to create seamless applications.
    <br/><br/>
    I hold a degree in Computer Science from Harokopeio University of Athens, where I gained a broad foundation in multiple programming languages but found my passion in web development. My thesis, titled <i className='text-slate-300'>&quot;Evaluation and Utilization of World Wide Web Technologies for the Design and Development of a Content Management System&quot;</i> focused on using modern web tools to enhance content management.
